Implement a proxy client that wraps a kafka client.  its job is to hide complexities of talking to a topic.  This client should talk to another Kafka metadata service that for now can be simply an interface that can be stubbed out.  This metadata server will support providing broker info for a given topic name along with things like what the security connectivity is for that topic, such as mutual auth.  The wrapper should also support the ability to intercept the consumer and producer so that logging can be inserted along with message augmentation.  Offer a simple framework for registering callbacks for both consumer and producer.
